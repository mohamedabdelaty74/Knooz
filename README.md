Automated Data Analysis for Branch Insights

Developed a Python program to automate frequent tasks related to customer visit analysis and growth prediction for a business branch. The program simplifies the following processes:

Customer Insights: Compares customer data across two months, identifying unique and repeated customers, calculating visit counts, and generating insights such as the percentage of repeated visits.
Growth Rate Calculation: Analyzes sales data over multiple months to compute growth rates.
Sales Target Prediction: Predicts next monthâ€™s sales target based on historical sales data and growth trends.
The program utilizes Pandas for data manipulation, Tkinter for file selection, and Excel for report generation. This tool significantly reduces manual effort and ensures accurate analysis.
